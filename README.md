PhotographR
===========
This is what a profound passion for photography does to us, we save money, buy an expensive, complicated professional camera, read the manual, and start taking thousands and thousands of photos to maybe understand the difference between using ISO 100 and ISO 400. With PhotographR you donâ€™t need to do that anymore. You can use our App to see photos of the same object with different settings taken by professionals worldwide, compare them, and learn.
